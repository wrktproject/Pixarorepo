## Inspiration

Pixaro's image processing algorithms are inspired by and reference the excellent work of:

### Darktable
- **Project**: [darktable-org/darktable](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable)
- **License**: GPL v3
- **Inspiration**: Color processing algorithms, tone curve calculations, and adjustment methodologies
- **Note**: Pixaro implements its own algorithms in WebGL shaders, inspired by Darktable's approach

### Open Source Libraries

- **React** - MIT License - UI framework
- **Redux** - MIT License - State management
- **TensorFlow.js** - Apache 2.0 - AI-powered features
- **Vite** - MIT License - Build tool

## Algorithm References

Our image processing is inspired by professional photo editing software and implements:
- sRGB gamma correction (IEC 61966-2-1 standard)
- Perceptually uniform color adjustments
- Luminance-based tone mapping
- Bilateral filtering for noise reduction
- Gaussian blur for clarity effects

## Disclaimer

Pixaro is an independent, open-source photo editing application. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to:
- Adobe Inc. (Lightroom, Photoshop)
- Darktable developers
- Any other commercial photo editing software

All implementations are original work using standard image processing techniques and open-source libraries.
